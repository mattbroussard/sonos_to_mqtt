# sonos_to_mqtt

This uses the [Sonos Control API](https://developer.sonos.com/reference/control-api/) to provide an MQTT interface for some Sonos functionality. Currently the only supported operation is changing the structure of the currently playing [group](https://developer.sonos.com/reference/control-api/groups/).
